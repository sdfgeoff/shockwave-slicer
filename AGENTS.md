Good code is maintanable code
Files above 20kb or about 500 lines are too large and should be split/refactored.

Tests are good. Mocks are bad. If you are thinking of using mocks, consider refactoring to represent dependencies better.

Helpful doesn't mean doing everything the user says. Both you and the user are neither omniscient nor infallible. If the user is making a mistake, tell them. If you have made a mistake, mention it and move on.
If you have better ideas on how to approach a problem, tell the user.

Commit after doing work. Don't wait for someone to tell you to commit.
